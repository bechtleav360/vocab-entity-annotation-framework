## Example

```turtle
@prefix eav: <http://w3id.org/eav/> . 

:x a sdo:LearningResource
  sdo:requiresCompetency esco:SkillA

<<:x sdo:requiresCompetency esco:SkillA>> 
  eav:recommendation :r1
  eav:recommendation :r2

:r1 a eav:Recommendation
  eav:confirmCount 42
  eav:rejectCount  12
  eav:positiveFeedback "good recommendation"

:r2 a eav:Recommendation
  eav:confirmCount 3
  eav:rejectCount  45
  

```
