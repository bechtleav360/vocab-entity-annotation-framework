# Annotations

An annotation refers to the process of adding descriptive information to a document, piece of data, or other type of information resource. Annotations can take many forms, such as tags, keywords, comments, or notes, and are designed to provide additional context, meaning, or structure to the underlying content.

Annotations are used in knowledge management to help organize, categorize, and retrieve information more effectively. By tagging or annotating documents with relevant keywords, for example, users can quickly search and locate specific pieces of information within a larger repository or database. Annotations can also be used to provide additional context or insight into a particular piece of information, helping to enrich its meaning and value to other users.

Overall, annotations play an important role in knowledge management by helping to make information more accessible, understandable, and usable.
