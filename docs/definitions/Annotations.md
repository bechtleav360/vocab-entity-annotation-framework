# Annotations

An annotation refers to the process of adding descriptive information to a document and other types of information entities. Annotations can take many forms, such as tags, keywords, comments, or notes, and are designed to provide additional context or structure to the underlying content.

Annotations are used in knowledge management to help organize, categorize, and retrieve information more effectively. By tagging or annotating documents with relevant keywords, for example, users can quickly search and locate specific pieces of information within a larger repository or database. Annotations can also be used to provide additional context or insight into a particular piece of information, helping to enrich its meaning and value to other users.

We should distinguish between individual and public annotations. By default, annotations like tags or notes support the individual organization of entities. The accumulation of all Tags is commonly called a folksonomy [^1]. The individual annotations can serve as input of machine learning models.
