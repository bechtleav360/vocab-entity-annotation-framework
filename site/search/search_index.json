A common definition does not exist [1]. It is typically associated with Semantic Web Technologies such as RDF or OWL. The Knowledge Graph places no limits on the kind of knowledge captured in its nodes and edges. Sensor data, abstract concepts, .. anything goes as long as it can be expressed in properties and relations. The proposed annotation framework is limited to individual entities (or just \"individuals\"). An entity has an identity, typically expressed through a name (aka named entities such as place names or persons) or globally unique identifiers (or \"characteristic properties\" [2])</p> <p>The proposed framework provides a common vocabulary to capture recommendations and annotations for entities, typically coming from users, statistical models and/or machine-learning models. While the entity graph captures knowledge about our world, the annotations capture our assumptions about certain properties of these entities.</p>"},{"location":"#commands","title":"Commands","text":"<ul> <li><code>mkdocs new [dir-name]</code> - Create a new project.</li> <li><code>mkdocs serve</code> - Start the live-reloading docs server.</li> <li><code>mkdocs build</code> - Build the documentation site.</li> <li><code>mkdocs -h</code> - Print help message and exit.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#project-layout","title":"Project layout","text":"<pre><code>mkdocs.yml    # The configuration file.\ndocs/\n    index.md  # The documentation homepage.\n    ...       # Other markdown pages, images and other files.\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"definitions/Annotations/","title":"Annotations","text":"<p>An annotation refers to the process of adding descriptive information to a document, piece of data, or other type of information resource.

By tagging or annotating documents with relevant keywords, for example, users can quickly search and locate specific pieces of information within a larger repository or database.

User feedback can take many forms, such as explicit ratings, reviews, surveys, or implicit signals, and is used to improve the accuracy, relevance, and overall performance of machine learning models.</p> <p>User feedback is an important component of the iterative process of machine learning model development. By gathering input from end-users, data scientists can gain insights into how well a model is performing in real-world scenarios and make adjustments to improve its accuracy or relevance. For example, a recommendation engine might collect feedback on the quality of its recommendations or an image recognition system might solicit feedback on the accuracy of its classifications.</p> <p>In addition to improving the performance of machine learning models, user feedback can also be used to ensure that machine learning applications are aligned with the needs and preferences of their intended audience. By collecting feedback on user experience, data scientists can identify areas for improvement, refine user interfaces, and enhance the overall usability of their applications.</p> <p>Overall, user feedback plays a critical role in the development and refinement of machine learning models and applications, helping to ensure that they meet the needs and expectations of their users.</p>"},{"location":"definitions/Layers/","title":"Layers in the knowledge graph","text":"<p>This framework builds on the assumption that we can separate a knowledge graph in the following distinctive layers: </p>"},{"location":"definitions/Layers/#layer-1-entities","title":"Layer 1: Entities","text":"<p>the immutable entities layer (or data, or documents, or whatever): the baseline, storing the facts.

Assertions can be based on facts, but they can also be subjective or opinion-based. For example, an assertion might be made about the effectiveness of a particular marketing strategy or the potential impact of a new policy proposal.</p> <p>Recommendations are similar to assertions, but they are typically focused on action or decision-making. Recommendations are suggestions or advice that are given to someone who is facing a particular challenge or problem. They are often based on a combination of facts and expert opinion, and are designed to help the recipient make a more informed and effective decision.</p> <p>In the context of knowledge management, facts, assertions, and recommendations can all be used to support decision-making and improve organizational performance. Facts can provide a foundation of objective information on which to base decisions, while assertions and recommendations can help to guide thinking and action in more subjective areas.</p> <p>For example, in the context of data analysis, facts might include metrics such as sales figures, customer demographics, or website traffic.

Recommendations are generated using machine learning algorithms that analyze user behavior and patterns in the data to predict which resources are most likely to be of interest or value to a particular user.</p> <p>The process of generating recommendations typically involves several steps. First, data is collected on user behavior, such as which resources they have accessed, how long they have spent on each resource, and whether they have taken any specific actions (such as commenting, sharing, or rating the resource). This data is then processed and analyzed using machine learning algorithms, which use pattern recognition and predictive modeling techniques to identify correlations between user behavior and resource characteristics.</p> <p>Based on this analysis, the machine learning algorithm generates a set of personalized recommendations for each user. These recommendations can take many forms, such as a list of recommended articles or videos, a set of suggested courses or training programs, or a list of relevant experts or communities.</p> <p>The goal of recommendations in knowledge management is to make it easier for users to discover relevant and valuable information resources, even within a large and complex knowledge base. By presenting users with personalized recommendations, knowledge management systems can help to improve engagement, promote knowledge sharing, and enhance the overall quality of the knowledge base.</p>"},{"location":"definitions/Recommendations/#example","title":"Example","text":"<pre><code>@prefix : &lt;http://example.org/&gt;\n@prefix sdo: &lt;https://schema.org/&gt; .\n@prefix xsd: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#&gt; .\n@prefix skill: &lt;http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill&gt; .\n@prefix mav: &lt;http://data.europa.eu/esco/&gt; .\n\n\n:x a sdo:LearningResource\n   sdo:title \"Brew your own beer.
